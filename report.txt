Report: CORD-19 Metadata Analysis
        Objective
To explore and visualize trends in COVID-19 research using the CORD-19 
metadata, focusing on publication patterns, journal activity, and 
thematic content in paper titles.

        Key Findings
1. Publication Trends
Research output peaked between 2020 and 2021, reflecting the global 
urgency during the pandemic’s early phase.

A steady decline followed in 2022, suggesting a shift toward
post-pandemic studies or saturation in certain topics.

2. Top Publishing Journals
The most active journals included medRxiv, bioRxiv, and Journal of 
Virology, indicating a strong presence of preprint servers and 
virology-focused outlets.

These journals contributed significantly to rapid dissemination of 
findings during the crisis.

3. Title Word Frequency
Common words in paper titles included “COVID”, “SARS”, “pandemic”, “infection”, “response”, and “vaccine”.

This highlights dominant research themes such as disease 
characterization, public health response, and vaccine development.

4. Source Distribution
Major data sources included PMC, Elsevier, and WHO, reflecting a mix of 
open-access repositories and institutional contributions.
